Developed a pleasing interface for Teachers where they can monitor the attendance records, It can be exported in many formats SQL, JSON, Excel, CSV’s etc. Won 2nd price in “World of IoT with NodeMCU”.

### Tools used:
- NodeMCU, MFRC522 Scanner
- HTML, CSS, JS
- PHP, MySQL
- XAMPP

### Runing Project
- Make Connections as shown is PPT
- Download Arduino IDE [here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)
- Connect the NodeMCU with your system and make sure both are connected to same WiFi
- In the IDE -> Tools Tab -> Board select NodeMCU Board
- In the IDE -> Open .ino File give in code folder -> Sketch Tab -> Upload
- Now u can dicsonnect NodeMCU Board and plug it anywhere for recording attendance
- Move the loginSystem folder into www folder of xampp
